Need is first, is last, or other author number; and author ratio and proportion

     ## - size of bubble by # grant dollars
    ## - size of bubble by # collaborators
    ## - color by gender

Analysis

# 4 - a) author position and dollar amount - look at median or mixed effects modeling on author position
# 5 - b) do gender analysis against position, dollar amounts
# 2 - c) dollars represented as lead investigator versus author - do a line graph comparison? side by side tabular lists?  some combination with a) above?
